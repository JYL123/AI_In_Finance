# AI_In_Finance

## Objective
* Build a stock price prediction algorithm in python using Keras and Tensorflow

## Structure
* Frontend

  Frontend simple webpage is build with [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-is-react)-[Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux). The learning summary can be found [here](https://github.com/JYL123/AI_In_Finance/tree/master/toyapp).

* Machine learning

  Machine learning part is to supply the stock price number needed in the frontend. The algorithm will be referenced from [this website](https://github.com/llSourcell/AI_in_Finance).
